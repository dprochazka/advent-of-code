# My Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code in 2023 and onwards. Its purpose is to share my solutions with friends (and spread Christmas joy). This README serves mostly as a reminder for my future self.

## 2023 (Python)

- use poetry for dependencies
- a cookiecutter template is available in `.template`
- to use the automation for a new day, pass AoC session cookie through an env variable

## 2023 (Rust)

- actually started in 2024 to learn Rust
